# Shrimpkin Book

Every photographer probably dreams of publishing their own photography book. After years of shooting on film, Iâ€™ve got so many pictures I want to share with everyone, ideally printed on paper. While that dream is still _a bit_ out of reach, I made this app as a digital version of my own photography book, simply titled Shrimpkin Book.
